In <a href="https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2022/dnr-executive-summary" title="">a 2022 study</a>, the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at Oxford provided quantitative evidence on the growth of social media as a news source for 18- to 24-year-olds. TikTok as a source had increased fivefold between 2020 and 2022, and YouTube stabilised its share of young readers in Asia, the fastest growing populace in the world.</p> <p>Combined with Facebook and Twitter, these sources supply 66% of young people their main news source, and all rely on algorithms. To increase views, clicks and advertising revenues, they show stories that viewers want to see – and slant viewpoints further. The result? Increasingly polarised and conflicting views in society, as people are exposed to a less diverse diet of actual current affairs.</p> <p>As a geography teacher, I regularly ask students how they access news. Sadly, it is now rare that one hand will be raised when I ask about mainstream and unsponsored sources. We have accepted that reading newspapers comes with political and social angles, but social media exacerbates this further by denying broad coverage.</p> <p>I am often asked about my greatest fear for the future. Rather than climate change, I reply “poor information”, as this increasingly undermines cooperation and good citizenship that we, as an ingenious species, can use to solve global problems. My message to them is: “Don’t get news from algorithms.”<br incopy-break-type="webbreak"><strong>Ollie Davies</strong><br incopy-break-type="webbreak"><em>Balcombe, West Sussex </em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
